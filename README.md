# Poetify
Poetify is a Machine Learning Model written in Python on Jupyter Notebook, using the PyTorch library. This neural network built with transformer architecture functions to transform internet reviews into stylized poems. It does so by taking a review as an input, summarizes the review, and generates poems using the shortened summary.
