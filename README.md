# Poetify
Poetify is an artificial neural network written in Python on Jupyter Notebook, using the PyTorch library. This neural network built with an autoencoder architecture functions to transform internet reviews into stylized poems. It does so by taking a review as an input, summarizes the review, and generates poems using the shortened summary.
